description: 1 AV, 21 human-driven vehicles. Inspired by the famous 2008 Sugiyama experiment demonstrating spontaneous formation of traffic shockwaves (reproduced on the left video), and a 2017 field study demonstrating the ability of AVs to suppress shockwaves. The goal is to suppress the shockwaves and maximize the velocity.
